# Nameless

This FFXI Windower v4 addon hides the player's floating nameplate in Final Fantasy XI. This may be impacted by other addons that also alter the name plate due to invisible triggers.

Thanks to: 
https://github.com/AkadenTK for letting me know they were already working on something that could hide name plates.
https://github.com/RubenatorX for pointing me in the direction of some better ways to trigger the post-zone event instead of using scripted timing delays.
https://github.com/Darkdoom22 in additon to the two above for working out EntityFlagChanger

## Features

This is a very basic script to trigger hiding the player's name plate in FFXI. There are no associated commands. Unload the addon and zone if you want your name to appear again.

Your name will still appear while interacting with some points and NPCs. It will breifly be visible after you change zones.
