# Nameless

This addon hides the player's floating nameplate. This may be impacted by other addons that also alter the name plate due to invisible triggers.

Special thanks to: 
https://github.com/AkadenTK for letting me know they were already working on something that could hide name plates.

## Features

This is a very basic script that simply hides the player's name plate. There are no associated commands. Unload the addon and zone or interact with an NPC if you want your name to appear again.

Your name will still appear when interacting with any NPC, and briefly after you have changed zones.
